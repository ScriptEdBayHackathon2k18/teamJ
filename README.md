## Inspiration

We were inspired by current events and how teens do not have a voice in government. Also, March for Our Lives was created by teens, and we want them to have more of a voice. Furthermore, we believe that involving more people will be more impactful. 

## What it does

Teens can send in submissions to their local congressperson voicing their concerns in their community. A page is created for each school community and the different issues. In addition, other community members can contribute their opinions on the comment section. 

## How we built it

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to build our webpage. Each page has their own CSS, HTML, and JavaScript file. Within JavaScript, we use click handlers and functions to make our page interactive. 

## Challenges we ran into

The challenges we ran into are the map, the congressperson's view page almost crashing several times, connecting CSS with the HTML, and the interactive comment section. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The accomplishments that we're proud of are:
- Incorporating the map
- The redirect using window.location for the button 
- Carousel on the images in the home page 

## What we learned

We learned many codes:
- window.location 
- carousel 
- How to implement interactive comments and the map 
- How to embed a video 

## What's next for Youth Voice

The next step for Youth Voice is creating merchandise including T-Shirts and stickers.
